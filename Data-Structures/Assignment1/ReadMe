# Introduction
This is a creation of basically an Array, just in Python.
I took it up to completely write this in NeoVim as well.

## Uses
This data structure has your typical Array functions that you'd noramally see in Java.
- Append - Enters a new value to the end of the array
- Prepend - Enters a new value to the start of the array
- Head - shows the first value in the array
- Tail - shows the last value of the array
- Pop - returns the last value of the array and removes it
- Find - returns the index and value of which you seek, returns "none" if not found
- Contains - returns true if found or false if failed to find
- Size - returns the size of the array
- Index - returns the value at the given index
- Print - prints every value in the array
